# Content-Sharing-website---OOPS-JavaScript-Node.js-
Developed a fully dynamic content sharing web application, using Node.js, Express.js, JavaScript, and MongoDB. 'Plant a Tree' meets the MVC design pattern with EJS template pages for the presentation, routes for the controller and JavaScript data objects for the business logic. The Project also handles each user Session, Login, Logout, Authentication, handling POST/GET requests, Handling Input Validation and Object-Oriented Concepts. The logged-in users have the facility of adding, saving, editing, removing and rating bonsai plant details, with the logged activity saved in Mongoose when user logout.
